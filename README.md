# BudgetAway - Holiday Trip Planner

Group project using React and Spring frameworks.
Required Spring application located at: https://github.com/selsmie/budgetaway_react

Live application on Heroku: http://budgetaway-react.herokuapp.com

Start the server by running the application (using IntelliJ IDEA CE)

## MVP

Create a web application that allows users to: -
- Select a country from a list - using API https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/all
- View details about the country (language, currency etc)
- Look up flights - using API https://aviationstack.com
- Set a current location, with the country being used to filter the flights look up
- Add and remove a trip from a favourites list
- Create price for a trip
- Use a saving calculator to determine how long it would take to save for the trip based on an input monthly saving amount

## Extensions
- Update the saving calculator to take in a salary, deducting off regular expenses, to then provide the time required to save for the trip
- Allow the savings required to be displayable by saving amount or time required
- Allow the user to add a deposit to savings

## Advanced Extension
- Integrate a map to display when selecting country
